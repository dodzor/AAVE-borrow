* the smart contract implements the AAVE contract
* Ganache-CLI -> fork the ETH mainet and use the AAVE contracts without spending crypto 
* REQUIREMENTS:
    1. smart contract
    2. test
    3. migration script
    4. reactjs website(at least a borrow button that calls the function)
* starter kit: https://github.com/dappuniversity/starter_kit
